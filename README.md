# Differential-Pulse-Code-Modulation-DPCM
Simulating a Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (DPCM) with Uniform Quantizer

**DPCM**: 

In Differential Pulse Code Modulation the quantized signal sent to the receiver is the difference between the current sample and a linear prediction. Each time we calculate a prediction from the past samples and then calculate the error of that prediction.
